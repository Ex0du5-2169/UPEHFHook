You know the drill. Stick it in your bepinex/plugins folder. If that doesn't ring a bell, go look up how to install bepinex.

**You will need Yotan's core mod and HFramework mod: ** Without them birth will NOT work.

This is a very early release for those who want to try it. It is NOT a 'feature-complete' mod.

What it does: 
Allows various other female NPCs to get pregnant and give birth (Reika, Shino, Cassie etc).
Allows the use of 'perfume' item on more NPCs.

It does NOT: Add new scenes/animations etc.

Warnings:

It works, most female NPCs should now get pregnant and give birth as any other NPC does. My system is slightly janky. Don't worry, it won't break anything and you might not even notice.

There are no new birth animations yet: If the character doesn't have a birth animation they will simply go to the most appropriate place and stand on it. Just wait, they'll give birth in time. As people make new ones (or the devs do it) then this will eventually be fixed.

The pregnancy bellies you see are placeholders that I edited from existing game assets. These are temporary and will be replaced in time, as more art becomes available. If you wish to contribute your art, please contact me directly.
