# Mad Island Universal Pregnancy Expansion:
Allows more NPC chracters to get pregnant and give birth.

# What it does not do:
The mod DOES NOT add any new animations (the delivery animations are just duplicates of existing character anims). There are no new sex scenes, there are no new delivery scenes, yet. My code simply duplicates animations they do have under a different name to trick the game.
It DOES NOT add any new NPCs.
Custom NPCs are NOT supported (well, not without you doing the extra art and animations yourself).

# Current Version:
1.0 Candidate - Test build
Changes - New Swapping script by Shurutsue

# Installation:
Place the included 'bepinex' folder in your Mad Island folder (install bepinex first, see below) and overwrite files if asked.

If you do not know how to install bepinex then I suggest looking at this guide - https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

The current stable Bepinex build - https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2

- Note - Yotan's HFramework and YotanModCore are REQUIRED for my mod to work.

# Warnings:
- Creating a brand new save is ALWAYS advisable when modding games. Please, for our combined sanity, make a new game and save separately when playing with mods.
- Currently the mod will change the look of the NPCs that it affects. We're working on a fix. For now, just remember how they looked and use the 'operating table' workstation to change them back if my code fails to do so.
- At present, the mod will swap the skeletons of any compatible characters when pregnancy is detected. Due to the way the game is coded we had to be very round-about with the way we approached it. The mod gains more info on the skeletons that need swapping as those characters have sex. Let the scenes play out to max (pink bar for MC scenes).
- CombinedMeshDemosaic causes issues in the latest versions of the game. It could feasibly also cause conflicts with my mod. It is highly recommended to use the none.bat method and install Yotan's Core mod and Unofficial patches instead.

# Girls available for impregnation in the mod:
- Shino
- Sally
- Cassie
- Giant
- Large female native (removed due to pre-existing support)
- Elder sister native (removed as support is expected soon)
- Reika
- Nami
- Merry

# Planned updates:
- Custom birth chart (births calculated based on the NPCs rather than the current HFramework defaults).
- Cumflation effects + cum leaking?
- Hybrid Children NPCs?
