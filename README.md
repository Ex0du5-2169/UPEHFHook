# Mad Island Universal Pregnancy Expansion:
Allows more NPC chracters to get pregnant and give birth.

# What it does not do:
The mod DOES NOT add any new animations. There are no new sex scenes, there are no new delivery scenes, yet. My code simply duplicates animations they do have under a different name to trick the game.
It DOES NOT add any new NPCs.

# Current Version:
0.9.9 - Beta - testing release

# Installation:
Place 'UPEHFHook.dll' into your Bepinex/plugins folder and put 'miassets' into Mad Island_Data/StreamingAssets/AssetBundles (if the latter doesn't exist, make it).

If you do not know how to install bepinex then I suggest looking at this guide - https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html

The current stable Bepinex build - https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v5.4.23.2

# Warning:
Currently the mod will change the look of the NPCs that it affects. We're working on a fix. For now, just remember how they looked and use the 'operating table' workstation to change them back.

# Girls available for impregnation in the mod:
- Shino
- Sally
- Cassie
- Giant
- Large female native
- Elder sister native
- Reika
- Nami (she's not in the game yet, but she will be compatible as soon as she is introduced)
- Merry

# Planned updates:
Store NPC skins/other aspects in a dictionary and load them onto the new skeleton.
Add better preg belly textures - work in progress.
Add compatibility for Yotan's HFramework.
Cumflation effects + cum leaking?
Hybrid Children NPCs?
